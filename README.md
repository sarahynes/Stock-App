**Stock App**

This application will take a stock ticker as a command line input. For example, "AAPL" is Apple's
ticker on the New York Stock Exchange. The program performs 2 real-time API calls to AlphaVantage,
an API for sourcing stock data. It will print out information about the stock to the user. Examples
of data shown are daily price, low/high price for the day, volume, percent change, etc.

Getting Started:

1. Get a free API key here: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key

2. Create a txt file containing the key

3. Save your file as "AlphaVantageKey.txt"

4. Depending on where you save your file, modify line 32 in Main.java if necessary
